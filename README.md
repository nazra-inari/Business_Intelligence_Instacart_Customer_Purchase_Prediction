This is a work in progress. To see my current work, please . navigate to:  

## Exploratory Data Analysis  
* Establishes a data dictionary and the entity relationship diagram to gain a firm understanding of the data 3 million data points.  
* Analyze the information in all seven tables of the schema and drive data insights via data visualizations  
* Gain an understanding of the important features embedded in the data    
## Data and Feature Engineering
* Generate 2300 features to help predict the response variable  
* Abstract computation into functions to avoid code repetition  
* Write tests to ensure feature validity  
* Perform parallel computation on multiple processors to expedite results and save time  
* Transform data for machine learning and statistical modeling  
* Optimize final sparse data set to save space, read and write times  

## Model Building and Hyperparameter Optimization
* Currently in progress
